### Main items
* Factorial (Factorial.py)
* Palindrome (Palindrome.py)
* Prime (Prime.py)

### Problem List
Assignment 1: Write an app which asks users for the input and then prints the factorial for that number. 

Assignment 2: Create an app which detects if the input word is a palindrome or not. 

Palindromes are strings which when read from left to right are same as right to left. Examples below: 

mom 

dad 

madam 

The following strings are NOT palindrome: 

cat != tac 

car != rac 

bus = sub 


Assignment 3: Take input from the user and find out if that number is prime or not.
